            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p class="legal-updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026 &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Company:</strong> Zenkai Corporation, Denmark &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:contact@zenkaicorp.com">contact@zenkaicorp.com</a></p>

            <div class="short-version">
                <p>Use Zenkai responsibly. Don't reverse-engineer it, don't redistribute it, don't trade your rent money with it. We'll do our best to make great software. You accept that beta software has rough edges. Here's the full version.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>1. What You're Agreeing To</h2>
            <p>By using any Zenkai product (Zenkai Hub, AlphaTrader, Zenkai Dojo, or any future Zenkai product), visiting zenkaicorp.com, or participating in the beta program, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, don't use the products.</p>
            <p>These terms are between you and <strong>Zenkai Corporation</strong>, a company registered in Denmark.</p>

            <h2>2. The Beta Program</h2>

            <h3>What Beta Means</h3>
            <p>You're testing early-stage software. You understand and accept that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Features may be incomplete, buggy, or change without notice</li>
                <li>Training runs may crash or produce unexpected results</li>
                <li>The product may not work perfectly on all hardware configurations</li>
                <li>We may reset, modify, or end the beta program at any time</li>
                <li>Beta access does not guarantee access to the final product</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Your Beta Key</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your beta key is personal. Don't share it.</li>
                <li>One key per person. Don't create multiple accounts.</li>
                <li>We can revoke beta access at any time, for any reason, without prior notice.</li>
                <li>Beta keys will transition to license keys when the product launches. Beta participants will receive preferential pricing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Your Responsibilities as a Beta Tester</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Report bugs when you find them (the bug report button is there for a reason)</li>
                <li>Don't publicly share pre-release features or screenshots without permission</li>
                <li>Provide honest feedback — we can handle it</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. What You Can and Cannot Do</h2>

            <h3>You CAN:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use Zenkai products for personal, educational, and commercial purposes</li>
                <li>Train AI agents on games you legally own</li>
                <li>Use trading tools for learning, paper trading, and live trading at your own risk</li>
                <li>Share your results, trained model performance, and experiences publicly</li>
                <li>Stream or create content showing Zenkai products in use</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>You CANNOT:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble Zenkai software</li>
                <li>Redistribute, resell, sublicense, or share Zenkai software or your beta key</li>
                <li>Remove or alter any copyright notices, branding, or attribution</li>
                <li>Use Zenkai to develop a competing product</li>
                <li>Attempt to bypass beta key validation or licensing systems</li>
                <li>Use Zenkai products for any illegal activity</li>
                <li>Claim that Zenkai's AI predictions constitute financial advice</li>
                <li>Use Zenkai to manipulate markets or engage in market abuse</li>
                <li>Upload malicious files to the Model Hub</li>
                <li>Upload content to the Model Hub that is intentionally misleading</li>
                <li>Attempt to embed executable code in model files or metadata</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>

            <h3>Ours</h3>
            <p>Zenkai Corporation owns all rights to: the Zenkai software (source code, binaries, architecture), the Zenkai brand (name, logo, "Every Setback, Stronger," "Powered By Defeat"), the website content, documentation, and marketing materials, and all AI training frameworks, algorithms, and proprietary systems within the products.</p>

            <h3>Yours</h3>
            <p>You own: all AI models you train using Zenkai products, all training data you download or generate, all configurations and presets you create, all results, reports, and analyses you produce.</p>
            <p><strong>Your trained models are yours. Your data is yours.</strong> We have no claim to anything you create with our tools. If you train a DOOM agent that becomes legendary — that's your achievement, not ours.</p>

            <h3>Model Hub — Shared Content</h3>
            <p>When you upload a model to the Zenkai Model Hub:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You retain full ownership of your model and all associated content</li>
                <li>You grant Zenkai Corporation a non-exclusive, worldwide license to host, display, and distribute your uploaded content through the Hub — solely for the purpose of making it available to other Zenkai users</li>
                <li>This license ends when you delete the upload</li>
                <li>Other users who download your model may use it for personal training, fine-tuning, and experimentation within Zenkai products</li>
                <li>Other users may NOT sell, redistribute outside of Zenkai, or claim ownership of your shared models</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Portability</h3>
            <p>You can export your trained models, configurations, and training data at any time using the built-in Export function. You are free to use exported data however you wish — it's yours.</p>

            <h3>Game Files</h3>
            <p>Zenkai does NOT distribute game files. For games requiring original files (such as DOOM campaign mode), users must own legitimate copies. Atari arcade games included in Dojo are provided through legally licensed ROM packages maintained by the Farama Foundation (Gymnasium).</p>

            <h2>5. Financial Disclaimer (AlphaTrader)</h2>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p><strong>This is critical. Read it.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>AlphaTrader is a <strong>tool for learning and experimentation</strong>. It is NOT financial advice.</li>
                    <li>AI predictions are NOT guaranteed. Models can and will be wrong.</li>
                    <li>Past performance does NOT guarantee future results.</li>
                    <li>Zenkai Corporation is NOT a financial advisor, broker, or regulated financial entity.</li>
                    <li>We do NOT recommend specific trades, assets, or strategies.</li>
                    <li>You are solely responsible for your trading decisions and any financial outcomes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Never trade with money you cannot afford to lose.</strong></li>
                    <li>If you connect to live trading: you do so entirely at your own risk. Zenkai Corporation accepts zero liability for financial losses.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Model Hub — Shared Trading Configurations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Trading configs shared on the Model Hub are created by community members, NOT by Zenkai Corporation</li>
                <li>Zenkai does NOT verify, endorse, or guarantee the performance of ANY shared trading strategy</li>
                <li>Claimed performance metrics are self-reported and may not reflect real trading conditions</li>
                <li>Downloading and using someone else's trading config is entirely at your own risk</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>By using AlphaTrader or downloading shared trading configurations, you acknowledge that you understand these risks and accept full responsibility for your financial decisions.</strong></p>

            <h2>6. Hardware &amp; System Safety</h2>
            <p>We've built safety systems into every product (ResourceGuardian, hardware monitoring, auto-throttle, pre-run warnings). We take your hardware seriously.</p>
            <p>However:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We cannot guarantee that intensive AI training will not cause wear on your hardware</li>
                <li>If you ignore safety warnings, override throttling, or push your system beyond its capabilities, the consequences are yours</li>
                <li>We are not liable for hardware damage, data loss, or system instability caused by AI training workloads</li>
                <li>We recommend keeping your system updated, monitoring temperatures, and using the safety features we built</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Availability &amp; Updates</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We provide Zenkai products "as is" during beta. No uptime guarantees.</li>
                <li>We may push updates at any time. The auto-updater will notify you.</li>
                <li>We may discontinue features, change functionality, or restructure products.</li>
                <li>We'll do our best to communicate changes in advance, but beta means things move fast.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p><strong>To the maximum extent permitted by Danish and EU law:</strong></p>

                <li>This includes but is not limited to: financial losses from trading, hardware damage, data loss, lost profits, or business interruption</li>
                <li>Our total liability to you for any claim is limited to the amount you paid for the product (during beta: zero)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>This does NOT limit liability for:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fraud or intentional misconduct by Zenkai Corporation</li>
                <li>Death or personal injury caused by our negligence</li>
                <li>Any liability that cannot be excluded under Danish or EU law</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>9. Termination</h2>
            <h3>By You</h3>
            <p>You can stop using Zenkai products at any time. Uninstall the software, delete your data, email us to delete your account data. Done.</p>

            <h3>By Us</h3>
            <p>We can terminate your access if you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Violate these terms</li>
                <li>Share or redistribute the software or your beta key</li>

            </ul>
            <p>If we terminate your access, your locally stored data (models, configs, market data) remains yours. We just revoke the software license.</p>

            <h2>10. Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>These terms are governed by <strong>Danish law</strong>.</li>
                <li>Any disputes will be resolved in the courts of <strong>Denmark</strong>.</li>
                <li>Before going legal, we'd appreciate if you just emailed us. Most problems can be solved with a conversation. We're reasonable people building something we care about.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>

            </ul>

            <h2>12. Severability</h2>
            <p>If any part of these terms is found to be unenforceable by a court, the rest remains in full effect.</p>
